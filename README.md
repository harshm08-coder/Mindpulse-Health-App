# 🧠 Mindpulse Health App – Smart Health & Well-being Predictor

**Mindpulse** is a web-based health risk assessment app that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases such as **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Breast Cancer**. It also provides personalized wellness recommendations based on mental health and lifestyle indicators like **PHQ-9**, **GAD-7**, **sleep duration**, and **screen time**.

This project aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3)**: _Good Health and Well-being_ – promoting early detection, lifestyle awareness, and mental health care.
